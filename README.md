# WooCommerce Bank Transfer Through Stripe
This WooCommerce plugin is designed to seamlessly integrate with Stripe, enabling you to facilitate bank transfers as a payment option. Following the completion of a purchase, customers will receive a unique virtual bank account number. This virtual account serves as a destination for them to transfer funds from their online banking interface or through an in-person visit to their local bank branch.

Once the funds have been successfully deposited into the designated virtual account and have undergone the necessary clearing process, the order status will automatically transition from 'on-hold' to 'processing.' This streamlined process ensures a smooth and efficient handling of transactions, enhancing the overall user experience for both merchants and customers alike.
